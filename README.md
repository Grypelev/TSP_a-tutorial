# TSP_a-tutorial

This project is my thesis work for the B.Sc., in which I compare 6 popular methods of solving the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). In definition, is the problem of scheduling a tour with the minimum cost that a person has to follow in order to serve some customers. The project begins by using two exact methods for solving the TSP, the Brute Force algorithm and the Dynamic Programming. These two algorithms even if they give optimal solutions, their calculation time is increased exponentially. For that purpose,This project is my thesis work for the B.Sc., in which I compare 6 popular methods of solving the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP).
