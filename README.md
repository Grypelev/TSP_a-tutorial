# TSP_a-tutorial

  This project is my thesis work for the B.Sc., in which I compare 6 popular methods of solving the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). In definition, the TSP is the problem of scheduling a tour with the minimum cost, that a person has to follow in order to serve some customers. The project begins by using two exact methods for solving the TSP, the Brute Force algorithm and the Dynamic Programming. These two algorithms even if they give optimal solutions, their calculation time is increased exponentially. For that purpose, this project contains two heuristic algorithms, the Greedy algorithm, and the 2-Opt algorithm, aiming to reduce the calculation time. Finally, this project includes also two Meta-Heuristic algorithms, famous for solving the TSP, Simulated Annealing and Genetic Algorithm. The winning algorithm after the benchmarking is Simulated Annealing as it gave the smallest cost on different TSP occasions in the shortest amount of time.  
  Afterward, the TSP transferred in real-world problems as it pulls from Google APIs the necessary data, such as polar coordinates, distances or durations, etc.
